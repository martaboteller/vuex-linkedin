## About the project

I've followed this LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-vuex">course</a> offered by Alexander Zanfir.

This project shows how to use the state management pattern and library to more effectively handle the complexities in medium-to-large-scale Vue.js apps. This covers using getters to proces the state data, modifying data using mutations or making asynchronous calls using actions.

I am on my way to achieve a :rocket: fullstack overview!
